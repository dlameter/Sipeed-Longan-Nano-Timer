# Sipeed Longan Nano Timer
Using the device's display to create a kitchen timer that can be reset by pressing a button.

## Sipeed documentation
It may be hard to find documentation for this device, if you need it check it's datasheet found in the docs directory if you follow [this link.](https://dl.sipeed.com/LONGAN/Nano) there is a section that links to various helpful locations including the directory linked with all it's reference manuals and datasheets for the technologies involved.

## LCD Reference project
This project uses code from [Kevin Sangeelee's git repo](https://github.com/Kevin-Sangeelee/gd32v_test.git) which helped the project get to this state in such a short amount of time. I would recommend it as a good example project using alot of the Sipeed Longan Nano's features.

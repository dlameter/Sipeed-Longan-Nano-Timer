# Sipeed Longan Nano Timer
Using the device's display to create a kitchen timer that can be reset by pressing a button.

## Sipeed documentation
It may be hard to find documentation for this device, if you need it check [it's datasheet](https://dl.sipeed.com/LONGAN/Nano) there is a section that links to an online storage directory containing library references and a lot more.

## LCD Reference project
This project uses code from https://github.com/Kevin-Sangeelee/gd32v_test.git which helped the project get to this state in such a short amount of time. I would recommend it as a good example project using alot of this boards external features.
